# Ticket reserver for Kide.app

https://kide-tickets-client.onrender.com

Works on browser, reserving tickets requires an access code to prevent overusage. 
The app is deployed as a free instance on Render, so it might take some time to start running.
  
The bot will reserve the maximum possible amount of each ticket variant, top to bottom.
The user can choose to prioritize ticket types by a ticket index or a keyword, which 
can be helpful if the total reservable amount is restricted. Further instructions are provided
in the Help -tab of the app.

Users can sign up and login to the site, the idea is to be able to save favorite events 
to find them more handily when needed.

The UI is quite ugly, at least for now.
